There are many underlying factors which contribute towards weight gain in female and they are as follows:

<ol>Fluctuating oestrogen levels</ol>
<ol>Design of the female body</ol>
<ol>Naturally low metabolism</ol>
<ol>Fluctuating Oestrogen Levels</ol>

Firstly, the female body is more predisposed to store higher fat content due to fluctuating Oestrogen levels. This is something a women experiences throughout her life from menarche to menopause.

Another reason why women tend to put on weight easily because women have a naturally low metabolic rate. When a metabolism rate is low, the body takes longer to digest food or burn away fat.

Therefore, it is more difficult for an Indian woman to burn away fat even if she indulges in exercise on a daily basis.
