<h3><font color="pink"><bold>Spice Mix</bold></font></h3><p>
Instead of loading up your food with salt how about sprinkling some warming spices. Spices like Ginger, Black Pepper, Cinnamon, boasts of amazing fat-burning properties. They have great ability to control blood sugar. Meaning they can help prevent any spike in your glucose levels post a sugar or carb-rich meal. Know more about the effects of these spices:
</p>
<h3><font color="pink"><bold>Black pepper:</bold></font></h3> It raises the body temperature and increases metabolism. Black pepper also aids in digestion because when it is eaten, a signal is sent to your stomach to produce hydrochloric acid. This acid is crucial for digestion of protein and other foods in the stomach.

<h3><font color="pink"><bold>Chilli powder:</bold></font></h3> Chilli powder contains capsaicin, a powerful stimulant that raises the body temperature and increases fat-burning ability by up to 25%. Besides this, chilli powder reduces cholesterol levels.

<h3><font color="pink"><bold>Ginger:</bold></font></h3> Ginger increases metabolic rate and decreases appetite. It also helps in the digestion process.

<h3><font color="pink"><bold>Cinnamon:</bold></font></h3> Studies have found that having just 1/4 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon can increase your metabolism and improve the body’s ability to handle sugar by stimulating insulin activity. Cinnamon also keeps your body’s digestive system flowing smoothly.

<h3><font color="pink"><bold>Veggie Delight</bold></font></h3>
Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables every day because each food has its own set of known and unknown nutrients to offer so that you can get the entire spectrum of protection against disease.

Adding colorful raw veggies are crucial in order to get sufficient enzymes in your diet.

<h3><font color="cyan"><bold>Nutritional Supplements</bold></font></h3>
A well-balanced, nutritious diet is very often sufficient in all vitamins and minerals, but our usual diet is lacking in many of these. Vitamins and minerals play integral roles in the body metabolism. Chromium, Omega Fatty 3 acid, B-complex play a vital role in weight loss and are also needed for optimum energy metabolism. Vit E, Vit C, Zinc, Selenium are essential antioxidants to reduce the damage done to the body by environmental stress, pollutants, free radicals, etc. Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, are some of the nutrients needed for denser, stronger bones that will be ready to support the increased lean body mass.

<h3><font color="cyan"><bold>Weight Loss Foods</bold></font></h3>
Make sure to include foods like fish, chicken, eggs, low fat milk and yogurt, cottage cheese, sprouts, pulses and legumes, nuts and whole seeds (almonds, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds), fish oil, coconut oil, brown rice, apples, papayas etc.

<h3><font color="cyan"><bold>Detox Teas</bold></font></h3>
Make sure to include ginger lemon tea, mint tea, cinnamon tea etc to enhance the detoxification process of your liver.

<h3><font color="cyan"><bold>Stress Control</bold></font></h3>
Take control of your emotions. Do some lite yoga and meditate everyday for atleast 15 minutes. You can also take some brahmi with low fat milk, before bed. This will help you sleep better and give more energy the next morning.

<h3><font color="cyan"><bold>Herbal Therapy</bold></font></h3>
At Health Total we use various Ayurvedic herbs to detoxify your body to make it nutrient receptive. Some of the herbs we use for men include Triphala and Shilaji. These herbs help balance the doshas and reduce excessive meda dhatu from your body. They facilitate the process of fat burning or fat metabolism.

<h3><font color="cyan"><bold>Exercises Plan For Belly Fat Reduction</bold></font></h3>
We suggest a mild exercise plan, which includes 40-45 minutes of cardiovascular exercises along with some weight training exercises (push-ups, crunches, abs) to build up muscle mass (active). We recommend clients to do it for at least 5 times a week. This will help you regularize the flow of free fatty acids for burning. Moderate physical activity can help reduce your visceral fat, which is a dangerous type of fat that could lead to many metabolic disorders. Moderate exercise such as 40-45 minutes’ walk while being on our weight loss management plan can give you amazing results in terms of losing weight while helping you lower your body fat% and visceral fat in terms of your waist circumference.
